         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Rinascere</p>
         <p>Rinascere is an Italian term that loosely transates to "reborn" in English. When Mia began her craft in 2010 she was inspired by the concept that jewelry is an expression of our inner selves. This identity is maleable and is rediscovered frequently throughout all of our lives. Mia displays the esssence of growth, evolution, and rebirth through the unique structue of her pieces. She takes inspiration from the fragmented and wild structure of fire, the intricate coiling form of the snake, the delicate planes of butterfly's wing, and other universal symbols of change that occur in nature. 
            Rinascere specializes in a diverse range of gold jewelry. While Rinascere is known for their engagment rings, their necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and causal rings have been featured in fashion publications such as Vogue, Elle, Allure, InStyle, and Bazaar.  
         </p>
