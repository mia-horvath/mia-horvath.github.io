                     <h2>Get to know IZA</h2>
                     <p>IZA was started by Iza Russo whose grandmother, Sofia, immigrated to America from a small town outside of Rome 60 years ago. Sofia was a passionate chocolatier and her love of making and sharing chocolates was infectious. Iza Russo began IZA in her dorm at culinary school and it quickly became a hit not just among her peers but her professorsas well. IZA has grown into a well-regarded chocolate company, and in 2016 was featured in the Oprah Winfrey Show. </p>
